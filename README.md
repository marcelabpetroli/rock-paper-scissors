# Rock Paper Scissors

Are you even a junior developer if you haven't programmed a game of rock paper scissors? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think not!

While learning JavaScript in Adalab's Web Dev Bootcamp I wanted to keep practicing on my own, so I followed @developedbyed's amazing tutorial on how to create a fun game of Rock Paper and Scissors.
